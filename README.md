Implementation of a scoreboard for different ball sports

I implemented this scoreboard as part of a seminar in school. As I dind't have much programming experience by then, do not expect a nice coding style.
The repository contains the original version I handed in back in school and a refactored version where some obvious inelegances have been fixed.
